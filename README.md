 Practicing Data Manipulation


Using skills acquired through DATACAMP to explore a dataset about product carbon emissions.

According to a [Scientific Data Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01178-9) product emissions make up more than 75% of global emissions. In this query we explore which industry has the most carbon emissions. The Carbon Catalogue examined the carbon footprints of 866 commercial products from 8 industry sectors and 5 continents. 

From the industries that were apart of the study I intially thought Food, Beverage and Tobacco would be number one as I assumed that it included agriculture. But after reading the article agriculture is separate from product (which this article is studying) and global GHG from agriculture, forestry, or other land use makes up about 24%, leaving 76% to industry, transport, and electricity & heat production – all of which can be traced to specific products such as the manufacturing and transportation of goods (e.g., a T-shirt) or their energy consumption once in use (e.g., a computer or furnace in someone’s home). In addition, a substantial portion of the 24% arise from cultivating crops and farm animals, which in turn is attributable to the GHG embodied in the resulting products, namely food (Meinrenken et al, 2022). 

From the analysis we see that Materials group is the worst offender when it comes to carbon emissions with 11 industries in the group. Capital Goods comes in the second spot despite having only 4 industries. They could also be seen as the worst offenders because those 4 indutries are producing almost more carbon emissions than the other industries on the list. Software and Services come in a distant last place with only one industry in this study.
